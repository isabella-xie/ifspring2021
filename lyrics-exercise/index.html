                <h3>[VERSE 1 – kanye west]</h3>
                <p>Penitentiary chances, the devil dances</p>
                <p>And eventually answers to the call of autumn</p>
                <p>All them fallin' for the love of ballin'</p>
                <p>Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin</p>
                <p>Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums</p>
                <p>Based off the way we was branded</p>
                <p>Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon</p>
                <p>And at the airport, they check all through my bag</p>
                <p>And tell me that it's random</p>
                <p>But we stay winning</p>
                <p>This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending</p>
                <p>And a new beginning and a new fitted</p>
                <p>And some job opportunities that's lucrative</p>
                <p>This the real world, homie, school finished</p>
                <p>They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it</p>
                <p>I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS</p>
                <p>I won't be satisfied 'til all my n*ggas get it, get it?</p>

                <h3>[VERSE 2 – kanye west]</h3>
                <p>Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?</p>
                <p>The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing</p>
                <p>But this is more than just my road to redemption</p>
                <p>Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention</p>
                <p>As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me</p>
                <p>But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me</p>
                <p>I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me</p>
                <p>If a n*gga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet</p>
                <p>But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus</p>
                <p>Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics</p>
                <p>We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish</p>
                <p>Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick</p>
                <p>I insisted to get up off of this dick</p>
                <p>And these drugs, niggas can't resist it</p>
                <p>Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted</p>
                <p>If I ever wasn't the greatest, n*gga, I must have missed it</p>

                <h3>[VERSE 3 – kanye west]</h3>
                <p>I need more drinks and less lights</p>
                <p>And that American Apparel girl in just tights</p>
                <p>She told the director she tryna get in a school</p>
                <p>He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"</p>
                <p>It's been a while since I watched the tube</p>
                <p>'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news</p>
                <p>I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today</p>
                <p>They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday</p>
                <p>And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?</p>
                <p>I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach</p>
                <p>My guy said I need a different approach/p>
                <p>'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke</p>
                <p>It's not funny anymore, try different jokes</p>
                <p>Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O</p>
                <p>And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it</p>
                <p>Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit</p>
                <p>Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes</p>
                <p>I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it</p>
                <p>I'm coming after whoever, who has it?</p>
                <p>You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic</p>
                <p>That, y'all, it's like that, y'all</p>
                <p>I don't really give a fuck about it at all</p>
                <p>'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me</p>
                <p>Forgot about two things, my Black balls</p>

                <p>Ayy, yo</p>
                <p>I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid</p>
                <p>Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes</p>

                <p>Steam about a hundred and one L's</p>
                <p>Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson</p>
                <p>N*gga hat game was special</p>
                <p>It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals</p>
                <p>The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head</p>
                <p>Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead</p>
                <p>That meant code red, bent off the black skunk</p>
                <p>The black Dutch, back of the old shed</p>
                <p>If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in</p>
                <p>Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding</p>
                <p>Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan</p>
                <p>Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye</p>
