			<li>
				<p>1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
			</li>

			<li>

            <li>
				<p>2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter</p>

            <h2>Preparation:</h2>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
				<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
				<p>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
				<p>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</p>
			</li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
				<p>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.</p>
